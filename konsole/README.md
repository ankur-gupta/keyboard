# Konsole shortcuts

Install using GUI: 

_Settings_ > _Configure shortcuts_ > _Details_ > _More Actions_ > _Import scheme ..._

After importing, you should save the scheme:

_More Actions_ > _Save shortcuts to scheme_

Close and restart Konsole a few times after KDE and autokey shortcuts are in place and running.
