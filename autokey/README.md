# Settings for autokey 

These `autokey` settings make keyboard shortcuts in Kubuntu behave like in a Mac. Best used with a Mac keyboard.

## Installation

0. Install autokey.
1. Quit autokey if it's already running.
2. Backup existing settings in `~/.config/autokey`.
3. Git clone this repository.
3. Put this folder, named `autokey`, inside `~/.config` replacing existing 
`~/.config/autokey`. Even better solution is to clone this repository in a location where you keep your settings files and then symlink.
